# Doubly Linked List Implementation

## Assignment Details

As discussed with your trainer, this assignment involves designing a doubly linked list with specific methods.

### Methods to Implement:

- `push(val)`: Adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list.
- `pop()`: Removes the last node from the list.
- `shift()`: Removes the first node from the list.
- `unshift(val)`: Adds a new node with the given value to the beginning of the list.
- `get(index)`: Retrieves the value of the node at the specified index.
- `set(index, val)`: Updates the value of the node at the specified index.
- `insert(index, val)`: Inserts a new node with the given value at the specified index.
- `remove(index)`: Removes the node at the specified index from the list.

### File Structure

To complete this assignment, create the following files:

- `Node.js`: Define a Node class that represents a node in the doubly linked list.
- `DoublyLinkedList.js`: Implement the doubly linked list class with the above methods.
- `main.js`: Use this file to test and demonstrate the functionality of your implemented methods.

### Implementation Guidelines

- Each class (Node and DoublyLinkedList) should be in its own `.js` file named `Node.js` and `DoublyLinkedList.js` respectively.
- Ensure that your methods handle edge cases such as invalid indices gracefully.
- Write test cases in `main.js` to verify the correctness of each method implementation.
